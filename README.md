# React Toggle Button Component

A toggle button which makes http requests asynchonously. It is written as a React component, and is published to npm. It is simple to initialize on the page, and fully customizable. You simply pass it the dom element which will wrap the component, the initial state of the toggle button, an http request object containing the resource URI, and a callback that will do something with the data returned from the server. You can even fully customize the text, look and feel with a simple options argument! See below for usage examples.
